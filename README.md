# EG-bio-upcycling
Metabolic modelling for biological upcycling of ethylene glycol (EG)

* Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a thermoplastic polyester of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG) monomers (Kim and Lee, 2012).
* Sustainable hydrolysis of PET gives TPA and EG that can be used as a carbon source in yeast.
* *Rhodotorula toruloides* is a nonconventional, oleaginous yeast that can naturally accumulate high amounts of lipids and carotenoids, up to 76% as part of its dry biomass (Ageitos et al. 2011), and consume a wide variety of carbon substrates, including complex biomass mixtures (Bonturi et al. 2017).
* The repository contains the development of constraint-based metabolic models for EG utilisation as a carbon source in non-conventional yeast *Rhodotorula toruloides*.
